## Patatap Clone
This was my basic morning exercise for 02/12. Something I learned with this project:
- The canvas element
- Paper.js and Howler.js
- Not being overwhelmed when reading docs
- Using an array to add a circle which would then be iterated on, which is still kind of confusing to think of.
